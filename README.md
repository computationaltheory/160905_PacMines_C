# 160905_PacMines_C
Juego final de teor√≠a computacional
This game needs the funcionespacmines.h library (included in this repository) to be compiled.

However, there is also the executable version ready to be executed.

The project language is the programming language C.

This game is the result of the conceptual mix of the Pac-Man and Minesweeper games. Since they are games that despite having a simple interface and basic gameplay, I consider they are related to the subject by their computational logic.
